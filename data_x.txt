quite stable from a pulmonary standpoint throughout his hospitalization  5  at the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias or arthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is still somewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates an effusion but is responding well to rehabilitation  it was felt that the patient perhaps had a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis which resolved quickly to a ck of 177 five days later  this rise in ck did coincide with increased muscle aches  it was not felt that there was enough manipulation to skeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this  it was thought that this was an insignificant mb fraction  the patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have an elevated ck of 1522  again , this joint demonstrated elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that it was a septic joint  the patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side and under fluoroscopic examination  the left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospital stay  it was determined that the patient should not have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warm or erythematous  since that time the right knee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patient has tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amount of his range of motion  the patient continued to have symptoms of right knee effusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on 7/2/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis  there were no complications  the patient's knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior to closing all of the effusion was drained  therefore the patient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/24/2000  the patient's right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warm during the initial part of the hospitalization  there were no bacteria on gram stain or culture  though the fluid did demonstrate elevated white blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutely infected  the patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the rheumatology service  it was though that along with left

or hypotension  he did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia thought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia  he did demonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the early phase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsis resolved  there was some concern throughout the patient's hospital course that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in place however this never manifested as a problem  the indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia  on 10/16/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without complications

his hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelets were noted to be 538  hematology: on admission the patient demonstrated a thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 51  6  the patient does have obstructive sleep apnea and used his bipap at night throughout his hospitalization  the patient was initially maintained in the emergency room on high flow oxygen however was quickly weaned to nasal cannula and then room air  pulmonary: the patient was quite stable from a pulmonary standpoint throughout his hospitalization  5  at the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias or arthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is still somewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates an effusion but is responding well to rehabilitation  it was felt that the patient perhaps had a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis which resolved quickly to a ck of 177 five days later  this rise in ck did coincide with increased muscle aches  it was not felt that there was enough manipulation to skeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this  it was thought that this was an insignificant mb fraction  the patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have an elevated ck of 1522  again , this joint demonstrated elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that it was a septic joint  the patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side and under fluoroscopic examination  the left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospital stay  it was determined that the patient should not have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warm or erythematous  since that time the right knee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patient has tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amount of his range of motion  the patient continued to have symptoms of right knee effusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on 7/2/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis  there were no complications  the patient's knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior to closing all of the effusion was drained  therefore the patient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/24/2000  the patient's right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warm during the initial part of the hospitalization  there were no bacteria on gram stain or culture  though the fluid did demonstrate elevated white blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutely infected  the patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the rheumatology service  it was though that along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septic polyarthritis  musculoskeletal: one of the patient's major presenting complaints was significant arthralgia and myalgia  4  he did rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission  the patient's cardiac function appeared to be stable throughout his hospitalization  mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent with elevated right heart filling pressures  the patient as mentioned above , underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderately dilated right ventricle with moderately depressed systolic function  his lopressor was increased in response to this and the patient was tolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia or hypotension  he did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia thought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia  he did demonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the early phase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsis resolved  there was some concern throughout the patient's hospital course that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in place however this never manifested as a problem  the indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia  on 10/16/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without complications  as mentioned above , the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation noted on the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetation was hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole  by 8/10/2000 the pacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing  however it rapidly became clear that his pacemaker was malfunctioning demonstrating only occasional pacing spikes  cardiovascular: on admission the patient was noted to have t-wave inversions anteriorly on his electrocardiogram  3  the patient's extraocular muscles were left intact with the thought of placing a prosthesis at a later date  the patient's eye healed well through the remainder of his hospital course and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter  ultimately the patient had left eye enucleation  the patient was treated initially for his elevated pressure and then the following day his eye was aspirated and injected with vancomycin  it was felt from the time of presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left eye  ophthalmology: as described above , the patient presented with left eye pain and vision loss  2  his gram positive coverage will need to be continued for four weeks after his left eye enucleation  therefore once the infectious work up was completed , the penicillin was changed to vancomycin  of note , there was concern that the patient's fever could be secondary to a drug reaction  the patient's last positive blood culture was 0/7/2000  it was felt that the low grade fevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute infectious process at the time of discharge  there was no evidence of any abscess and the vegetation was no longer visible  the patient's fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay and on the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was no myocardial abscess  as mentioned above the patient was also treated for cellulitis and underwent left eye enucleation  these were interpreted both on the initial views and delayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but not diagnostic of infection  the patient also underwent a tagged white blood cell scan which demonstrated increased uptake in the left shoulder , manubrium , right knee , left ankle and mid shaft of the left tibia  the patient underwent multiple joint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clear evidence of infection  none of these proved to be a source  an extensive work up was undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation for possible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints  the patient's course was complicated by persistent fevers despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and left eye enucleation  this was treated with a ten day course of dicloxacillin and resolved without complications  the patient also had a right lower extremity cellulitis during his hospital course  it was determined that the patient would require enucleation which he underwent on 0/27/2000  unfortunately the patient continued to spike fever despite appropriate therapy for his gbs and his eye appeared to be worsening with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and a purulent exudate  the patient was injected intraocular with vancomycin at that time  at that time the patient's eye was aspirated and noted to also be infected by gbs  the elevated pressure was treated and he responded well by the following day  the patient presented complaining of left eye pain and loss of vision on the night of admission in the emergency room , the ophthalmologist saw the patient and determined that the patient had an elevated pressure  of note

patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have an elevated ck of 1522  again , this joint demonstrated elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that it was a septic joint  the patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side and under fluoroscopic examination  the left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospital stay  it was determined that the patient should not have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warm or erythematous  since that time the right knee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patient has tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amount of his range of motion  the patient continued to have symptoms of right knee effusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on 7/2/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis  there were no complications  the patient's knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior to closing all of the effusion was drained  therefore the patient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/24/2000  the patient's right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warm during the initial part of the hospitalization  there were no bacteria on gram stain or culture  though the fluid did demonstrate elevated white blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutely infected  the patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the rheumatology service  it was though that along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septic polyarthritis  musculoskeletal: one of the patient's major presenting complaints was significant arthralgia and myalgia  4  he did rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission  the patient's cardiac function appeared to be stable throughout his hospitalization  mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent with elevated right heart filling pressures  the patient as mentioned above , underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderately dilated right ventricle with moderately depressed systolic function  his lopressor was increased in response to this and the patient was tolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia or hypotension  he did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia thought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia  he did demonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the early phase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsis resolved  there was some concern throughout the patient's hospital course that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in place however this never manifested as a problem  the indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia  on 10/16/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without complications  as mentioned above , the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation noted on the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetation was hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole  by 8/10/2000 the pacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing  however it rapidly became clear that his pacemaker was malfunctioning demonstrating only occasional pacing spikes  cardiovascular: on admission the patient was noted to have t-wave inversions anteriorly on his electrocardiogram  3  the patient's extraocular muscles were left intact with the thought of placing a prosthesis at a later date  the patient's eye healed well through the remainder of his hospital course and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter  ultimately the patient had left eye enucleation  the patient was treated initially for his elevated pressure and then the following day his eye was aspirated and injected with vancomycin  it was felt from the time of presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left eye  ophthalmology: as described above , the patient presented with left eye pain and vision loss  2  his gram positive coverage will need to be continued for four weeks after his left eye enucleation  therefore once the infectious work up was completed , the penicillin was changed to vancomycin  of note , there was concern that the patient's fever could be secondary to a drug reaction  the patient's last positive blood culture was 0/7/2000  it was felt that the low grade fevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute infectious process at the time of discharge  there was no evidence of any abscess and the vegetation was no longer visible  the patient's fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay and on the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was no myocardial abscess  as mentioned above the patient was also treated for cellulitis and underwent left eye enucleation  these were interpreted both on the initial views and delayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but not diagnostic of infection  the patient also underwent a tagged white blood cell scan which demonstrated increased uptake in the left shoulder , manubrium , right knee , left ankle and mid shaft of the left tibia  the patient underwent multiple joint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clear evidence of infection  none of these proved to be a source  an extensive work up was undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation for possible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints  the patient's course was complicated by persistent fevers despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and left eye enucleation  this was treated with a ten day course of dicloxacillin and resolved without complications  the patient also had a right lower extremity cellulitis during his hospital course  it was determined that the patient would require enucleation which he underwent on 0/27/2000  unfortunately the patient continued to spike fever despite appropriate therapy for his gbs and his eye appeared to be worsening with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and a purulent exudate  the patient was injected intraocular with vancomycin at that time  at that time the patient's eye was aspirated and noted to also be infected by gbs  the elevated pressure was treated and he responded well by the following day  the patient presented complaining of left eye pain and loss of vision on the night of admission in the emergency room , the ophthalmologist saw the patient and determined that the patient had an elevated pressure  of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogram was negative for patent foramen ovale 0 centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspid valve and it was also noted to be hitting the pacemaker wire though not fixed to it 5x1  this demonstrated a 1  a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on the day of admission and did not demonstrate any vegetation , however with persistent high spiking fevers , sepsis and 4/4 blood culture bottles , repeated blood cultures growing gbs the patient had repeat transesophageal echocardiogram  the patient's antibiotics were changed to penicillin and gentamycin  on the second hospital day , the patient grew 4/4 bottles of what turned out to be group b streptococcus  the patient began to spike fevers from 100 to 101 range  the patient was hydrated aggressively and consistently pan cultured  infectious disease: the patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics in the emergency room and was rapidly noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 72  hospital course: 1  urinalysis essentially negative  ct of the head showed no evidence of acute bleed  no focal

the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of disease  the patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on several occasions  it was felt that because the patient would decline any intervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute renal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study  the patient declined any procedure such as carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid stenosis and due to this denial no workup with the cta was done  the left internal carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the mri and there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus stenosis  there was , however , no new stroke seen on the mri  he had mri at that time , which did show multiple old infarcts in the right frontal ,

during his hospitalization  in addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered with sliding scale insulin  however , he was later restarted on this  endocrine: given the numerous contrast

performed at the present time , however , the patient is informed , as the rehab hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient seem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be reevaluated by a physician  the patient appears well , and states that he is feeling at his best since the accident  the results are pending at the time of dictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient's discharge from the hospital  in addition , a repeat urinalysis was performed  otherwise , it was essentially negative  this was reviewed with an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes  the chest x-ray was performed on the 18 of april , which demonstrated no infiltrate  it was felt that this probably represented stress , given all the recent procedures that were done , including the catheterization and the electrophysiology studies , rather than a2 infection  of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the last two days of admission  infectious disease: there was no evidence of any acute infection  4  he was encouraged to take several deep breaths per hour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia  this pain was well controlled with the combination of dilaudid and oxycodone  it was therefore felt that given the negative enzymes and the negative cath , and the known rib fractures that the chest pain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain  however , he adamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon inspiring  the rib fractures were felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complain of some inspiratory pain throughout his chest  in addition , he was noted to have several rib fractures  with the impression of the orthopedic service that no acute intervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with sports medicine or orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks  he saw physical therapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated  he remained in a knee immobilizer  there was no evidence of fracture  this showed tears of the medial and lateral menisci  musculoskeletal: he was seen by the orthopedic service in the emergency department at the time of

bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis , however , could not be completed excluded  the mri/mra of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left bifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis  an mra of his head and neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system  given the fact that the patient remained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and radiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10 days old , and this was not further addressed  it was most likely represented an old cva , which was not previously detected  therefore , this was not felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle collision  therefore , given the fact that signal was seen on the t2 and flair , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was felt that this was at least 10 days old  there was a region of increase signal intensity on the t2 and flair images , involving the vasoganglion , extending the corona radiata  the

difficult to control diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both nph and lispro sliding scale while in house  endocrine  5  the patient was sating 98% on room air at the time of discharge  a more likely explanation for these findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate diuresis with his congestive heart failure  it is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung disease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on high resolution chest ct 5  his corrected dlco is 13  his lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted suggestive of a restrictive process and his dlco both corrected and uncorrected are 50% predicted  he has both decreased fvc and fev1 , but an fev1 and fvc percent that is most consistent with a mild restriction  this gives an fev1 to fvc percent of 71% 33 liters 88 liters and an fev1 of 1  pulmonary function tests revealed an fvc of 1  he also had pulmonary function tests  he had a high resolution chest ct , which showed mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process  given the fact that the patient had a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery pressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease was undertaken  pulmonary  4  the patient is not at this time a candidate for resynchronization

pacemaker  rhythm  3  the patient's heart failure regimen includes standing lasix , carvedilol , isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic improvement  on an outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have a trial of ace or arb to optimize his after-load reduction and neurohormonal activation with his heart failure 5 on ace inhibition  in the past , he had had a rise in his potassium to 5  of note , the patient has been exposed to ace inhibition in the past and is currently not on an ace inhibitor  by discharge , the patient was actually becoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a calcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past  his symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2 liters of the patient 7  his creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to 2  at this point , his after-load reduction was maximized with combination of hydralazine and isordil with good effect  there was some initial false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath lab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored therapy to the cardiac care unit where he had a pulmonary artery catheter in place  his ra pressure was 8  his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery pressure 56/18  the patient was taken to the cardiovascular diagnostic laboratory and received a right heart catheterization  given the fact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further diuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his right and

treatment of the hip by a multistage procedure , in which the hardware would be removed and antibiotics spacer placed temporarily while longterm iv antibiotic treatment was pursued for at least six weeks and finally the hip replaced with total arthroplasty , once evidence suggested that infection had been cleared  continued monitoring of vancomycin levels were therefore not recommended  and

mercury inspiratory and 7 mm of mercury expiratory , she was able to maintain oxygen saturations between 88% and as high as 93% oxygen saturation  on the evening that she did actually try both the c-pap and the bi-pap , she was noted to have labored breathing with the c-pap at 5 mm of mercury and four liters nasal cannula with a pulse oximetry dropping to 81%  while the patient was on the floor , we attempted to restart her on the bi-pap , however the patient resisted using both the c-pap and the bi-pap practically every night complaining that she had an upper respiratory infection that made it difficult for her to wear the machine  the overall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was most likely secondary to obesity  it was decided to follow-up on the ct in the future and to have the patient had a repeat sleep study as well as repeat pulmonary function tests  it was unclear what the nodular lesions described on the ct represented , whether it was inflammation or some sort of firm nodule  the pulmonary service had been consulted and it was thought that it was difficult to sort out exactly what was going on  she had a normal pulmonary vascular distribution , elevated right heart pressures with pulmonary arterial pressure of 44/13 with a mean of 28 mm of mercury , right ventricular pressure 52/2 with a mean of 20 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23  this study revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli  in order to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lung disease , the patient underwent a pa gram on july , 1996 to rule out the possibility of chronic pulmonary emboli  her chest ct on november , 1996 was significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema , patchy opacities in the right apex and lung bases with a nodular quality of unclear etiology and a lucent lesion in the right lobe of the liver that was too small to characterize  they were unable to exclude diastolic dysfunction given the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy  this echocardiogram was performed with a bubble study and there was no obvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or saline infusion  she had an echocardiogram on november , 1996 , which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% , mild left ventricular hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities , a top normal sized right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and a suggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm of mercury plus the estimated right atrial pressure  parenchymal disease  given the patient's history of restrictive lung disease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up to search for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs  the patient was transferred to the floor on february , 1996  after extubation , the patient was weaned to bi-pap with which she was able to maintain saturations between 86-90% while in the medical intensive care unit  her chest x-ray on admission was significant for a mild interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly  she was intubated on january , 1996 and quickly extubated on may , 1996 without complications  hospital course: 1 ) pulmonary: the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit on january , 1996 status post a respiratory arrest thought to be secondary to hypercarbia through the combination of the patient's underlying

echocardiogram which showed some left ventricular hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of approximately 55% , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspid regurgitation  there has also been a question in the past of possible diastolic dysfunction  the patient has been on chronic coumadin , however there is a question of whether or not , she has been taking it regularly  the patient has had multiple vq scans in the past , all of which have been low probability  she has a history of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she has had multiple medical admissions , most recently about six in the past year , most recently in march of 1996 , for cellulitis of the left lower extremity , in august of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness with negative non-invasive studies and in july of 1996 , most recently with right lower extremity cellulitis and this was complicated by apparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare  apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start the patient on the c-pap at home , but the patient had been resistant and she has a long history of medical non-compliance  the oxygen saturation decreased to 61% at the minimum and subsequently she had respiratory monitoring in july of 1995 with c-pap which revealed a decrease in the apnea episodes to 19 events in about 480 minutes with oxygen saturation decreasing to a minimum of 71%  she has been evaluated in the past with even trace apnea screen in november of 1994 which revealed approximately 19 apnea events in just over 10 hours  she has a history of obstructive sleep apnea  arterial blood gases on prior admissions have revealed po2 in 50 , pco2 in the high 40s to low 50s  she has been on long term home oxygen with oxygen
